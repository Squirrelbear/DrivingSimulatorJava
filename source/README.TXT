PROJECT TITLE: Driving Simulator
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
         To simulate a game where cars move down the screen and the 
         aim is to dodge the oncoming cars with the use of the mouse.
VERSION or DATE: 26/9/2009
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Right-Click on Driver and select "new Driver()"
AUTHORS: Peter Mitchell
USER INSTRUCTIONS: (For more comprehensive details please see User Guide)
To control your car click on the white car down the bottom and while holding the 
mouse down move your mouse to the left and right. This will move the car along 
on a single line. Be careful not to move your mouse too far away or you will lose
control of your car.
The aim of the game is to dodge the oncoming cars by moving your car side to side.
As you dodge cars your score will grow depending on the type of car. Each car is
worth different amounts. 
If you do collide with another car you will be asked if you want to play again.
If you press C you will be able to type in cheat codes that you want to activate
or deactivate. (See User Guide for the codes that can be used.)
You can also pause the game, start a new game, or change the difficulty at any 
time by interacting wit the controls on the left. Please note that when you have
changed the difficulty the game will automatically pause and you will need to 
press New Game to start you game with the newly selected difficulty.
